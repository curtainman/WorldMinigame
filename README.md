# WorldMinigame
A world minigame for spigot 1.16.1


Every 5 minutes, a new world will be generated with a new seed. Players will be teleported to the new world. Their location is their coordinates in the previous world but they will be teleported to the new world.




# Setup

Run /wmg in game to either stop or start the game. You must also have a world named "world" for evacuation if the game stops.
The command /wmgforceclean will delete the game-created worlds. This is only for debug purposes, and should only be used as a last resort.

I am updating this if there are bugs found, or if I want new features.
